- Collaborated in a team of 20 and with the Integrated Components Solutions AI Team to build an LLM-powered data dashboard using high IQ telematic sensor data where engineers can perform data mining and analysis tasks
- Completed 12+ projects related to data handling and Generative AI to gain hands-on exposure working with Caterpillar telemetric data and LLMs available through open-source providers like Ollama
- Key contributions:
  - Revamped https://github.com/NeoVand/Debater to allow a user to debate an AI agent instead of two agents debating each other infinitely
  - Developed functionality for a Visual Data Scientist tool to plot and analyze specific segments of telemetric data ranging from 200 to 500k+ data points
  - Integrated a feature for https://github.com/NeoVand/OllamaSQL to allow in-memory Pandas code execution
