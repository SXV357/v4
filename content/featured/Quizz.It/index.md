Quizz.It is a full-stack educational productivity application submitted as part of Purdue's BoilerMake XI hackathon. The platform is designed to streamline access to college students' most common educational needs, such as better understanding the contents of a document and questions to use to study for quizzes/tests. It was shortlisted for several awards such as Klaviyo's, "We always put our customers first", "Best use of AI in education", and BoilerBookings', "Project that helps college students the most".
