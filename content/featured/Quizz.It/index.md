Quizz.It is a full-stack educational productivity application submitted as part of Purdue's BoilerMake XI hackathon. The platform is designed to streamline access to college students' most common educational needs, such as getting concise summaries for large documents, questions to use to study for tests/quizzes, and the need to better understand the contents of a document. It was shortlisted for several awards such as Klaviyo's, "We always put our customers first", "Best use of AI in education", and BoilerBookings', "Project that helps college students the most".
